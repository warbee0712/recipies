Plum Duff
(Recipe started with Gladys Alley Hall)

2 cups cut-up pitted prunes (I buy dried prunes, add water to cover and bring to a simmer and cool (Drain water). Food process to mix up to smooth texture)

Beat 2 eggs

Blend in
1 cup brown sugar
½ cup shortening (I use softened butter)
Prunes

Sift together and stir in
1 cup sifted flour
½ tsp salt
1 tsp soda

Pour into well greased 1 quart mold.

Steam.

Time: 1 hour (Check at 30 to 40 minutes, should be firm, but not to firm. When edges are pulling from pan and tester comes out clean is a good thing to look for. Can pull of element and keep covered to finish steaming if close)

Amount: 8 servings

(I use stock pot w/steamer to steam)
