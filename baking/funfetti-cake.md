- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup (60g, 2.2oz) yogurt  (plain or vanilla; or greek yogurt; or sour cream)
- 3/4 cup (180ml, 6oz) milk (cow's milk; or soy milk; or almond milk)
- 1 Tablespoon (15ml) vanilla extract
- 2/3 cup (90g, 3.17oz) sprinkles (not nonpareils)

- 3-4 cups (360-480g 12.7-16.9oz) powdered (confectioners') sugar
- 1/4 cup (60ml, 2oz) heavy cream (see note above about substituting milk or half-and-half)
- 2 and 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- salt, as needed
- aluminum foil

### Helpful tools:
- scale
- baking/parchment paper
- medium bowl
- large bowl
- egg beaters/mixer

## Directions:

### Cake
1. Preheat oven to 350F (176C) degrees.
1. Spray a **9-inch springform or baking pan** (round or square) generously with **nonstick spray**. Set aside.
1. In a **medium bowl**, mix together **flour**, **baking powder**, **baking soda**, and **salt**. Set aside.
1. In a **large microwave-safe bowl**, melt **butter** in the microwave.
1. Whisk **white sugar** and **brown sugar** vigorously into the butter bowl, getting out any brown sugar lumps. The mixture will be gritty.
1. Whisk **egg**, **yogurt**, **milk**, and **vanilla extract** into butter and sugar mixture until combined.
1. Slowly mix in **dry ingredients** until no lumps remain. Batter will be thick.
1. Slowly stir in **sprinkles**, but _do not overmix because the sprinkles will bleed their color_.
1. Pour/spoon batter into prepared cake pan.
1. Bake it for 20 minutes, then cover loosely with **aluminum foil** (loosely to avoid the top from sticking to the foil).
1. Continue baking for 13-17 more minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
1. Allow to cool.

### Frosting
1. Beat **softened butter** on medium speed with an **electric or stand mixer** for 3 minutes until smooth and creamy.
1. With the mixer running, add **powdered sugar**, **cream**, and **vanilla extract**.
1. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 additional minutes.
  - _If frosting is too thin, add more powdered sugar. If mixture is too thick, add more cream, 1/4 teaspoon at a time._
1. Frost cooled cake as desired and top with sprinkles. There may be leftover frosting depending how much you wish to use.

Changes have been made that are editorial to make it easier for me to cook, like including oz, Celsius, and breaking up the steps into smaller list items.
