# Tea Biscuits

## Ingredients:
- 2 cups (16 oz) all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 1/2 cup (4 oz) butter or shortening, cut into small chunks
- 3/4 cup - 1 1/2 cup (6-12 oz) milk or half and half
- 1 egg

### Helpful tools:
- Large cutting board
- Baking sheet
- Food processor
- Food scale
- 1 large bowl
- 1 small bowl
- Cup or biscuit cutter

## Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
1. Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in food processor. Add butter in until mixture has a fine crumb texture. Move flour mixture to large bowl.
1. In small bowl, mix egg and 1/2 cup of the milk.
1. Stir in most of egg and milk mixture to the flour mixture. (The remaining one or two tablespoons are later brushed onto biscuits.) Combine to make a soft dough. If not enough liquid, slowly (SLOWLY) add more milk or half and half until it is the right consistency.
1. Move dough to well floured cutting board. Knead 8 to 10 times, and then roll out to a thickness of at least 1/2 inch. Be liberal with flour.
1. Cut into rounds with a cookie or biscuit cutter. Place on cookie sheet, brush with egg mixture, and allow to rest for a few minutes.
1. Bake for 8 to 15 minutes, until slightly golden. Serve warm.
